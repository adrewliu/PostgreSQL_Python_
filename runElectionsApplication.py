party is an attribute in the CandidatesForOffice table, indicating the candidate for officeâ€™s
party in an election. A candidate for office in an election runs in a particular party.
Every office holder must be a candidate for office, but some candidates for office are office
holders and some are not. Any office holder was in a particular party in the election in which
they were candidates for office. The argument, myConn, is the database connection and the argument,
theParty, is a string which is a party. This Python function prints out the number of candidates for
office and the number of office holders who were in myParty when they ran as candidates for office
in an election.
